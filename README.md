## About the Project

### Deployment / Code Repository

[Live deployment](https://tweetingcynical.github.io/code-quiz/)

[Repository](https://github.com/TweetingCynical/code-quiz)

### Screenshot

Working version of site should look like this at standard screen size:
![Site Screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

### Scope and Purpose

Build an interactive coding quiz with a series of multiple choice questions. The quiz should track the user's score, allow them to click a button to select their answer, and also track the time they have left. Finally, the user should be able to save their score to a high score page, and reset all stored scores on click of a clear button.

### Usage

This site and its codeset are for educational purposes only.

### Installation

## Pseudocode

Steps to achieving the working quiz:

* Set an intial timer of 60 seconds, and a score of 0;
* When user clicks start button:
  - Timer begins countdown;
  - Start screen set to hide;
  - Remove questions class 'hide';
  - h2 tag reads: QUESTION *ONE*;
  - Four buttons for answer choices appear next to content of answers;
* When user clicks correct answer:
  - Timer +=5;
  - Score ++;
  - Display next question;
* When user clicks incorrect answer:
  - Timer -+5;
  - Score no change;
  - Display next question;
* When either no more questions, or timer == 0, game ends:
  - Hide questions; 
  - Display end screen and score;
* When user submits initials:
  - Add score and initials to saved highscores object;
  - Display highscores page, listing stored scores in descending order from top;
    - This may require a for loop to append new child, and then access each child by index, assigning the text content by highest in the stored object;
* When user clicks Go Back, return to initial state;
* When user clicks clear Highscores, empty stored score and initial history.

## Overview of Build

Some of the key JavaScript skills being utilised:

* Use of an object of objects for storing a scalable question bank;
* Use of query selectors to get elements by id and class:

  ```javascript
  qBtn = document.querySelectorAll(".choice")
  const questionsScreen = document.querySelector('#questions')
  ```

* Use of for loops to create a set of buttons:

  ```javascript
  for(let i = 0; i < addQs.length; i++) {
    let opt = document.createElement('button');
    questionChoices.appendChild(opt).setAttribute("class", "choice");
  }
  ```

* Use of another for loop to supply each button with an event listener and its question/answer content. Also use of event.target to match the click target to its id:

  ```javascript
  for(let i = 0; i < qBtn.length; i++) {
  qBtn[i].setAttribute("id", addQs[i]);
  qBtn[i].addEventListener("click", function(event){
    if(event.target === this) {
      let answer = event.target.getAttribute('id');
      let correct = questions[currQ].correct;
      compareAnswers(answer, correct)
    }
  });
  ```

* Use of object.keys to allow indexing into an object:

  ```javascript
  let key = Object.keys(questions)
  ```

* Use of a timer to run every 1000ms:

  ```javascript
  function setTime() {
    let timerInterval = setInterval(function() {
      timeLeft--;
      if (timeLeft <= 0) {
        timerDisplay.textContent = 0;
        clearInterval(timerInterval)
        endQuiz()
      } else {
        timerDisplay.textContent = timeLeft;
      }
    }, 1000);
  }
  ```

* Use of functions to track multiple changing variables and display them on screen:

  ```javascript
  function addTime() {
    timeLeft +=5;
    currScore ++;
    scoreDisplay.innerText = currScore;
  }
  ```

* Use of add and remove classes to show and hide different on screen sections:

  ```javascript
  questionsScreen.classList.add("hide");
  endScreen.classList.remove("hide");
  ```

* Use of JSON parsing and stringify to store variables to local storage:

  ```javascript
  let storedHighScores = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("highScoresArray"));
  localStorage.setItem("highScoresArray", JSON.stringify(highScoresArray));
  ```

* Use of the sort function to sort the high scores leaderboard:

  ```javascript
  function sortArray(storedHighScores) {
  storedHighScores.sort((a,b) => {
    return (b[1] - a[1])});
  }
  ```

* Use of a while loop to remove the first child until there are none remaining:

  ```javascript
  while (highScoresOL.firstChild) {
    highScoresOL.removeChild(highScoresOL.firstChild)
  }
  ```

* Use of event listener to call a function:

  ```javascript
  clearBtn.addEventListener("click", clearHighScores)
  ```

### Suggested future changes

- âœ… ~~Store how many seconds the user has left at the end of the game, for use in the high score board~~
- Add sounds for correct and incorrect answers
- Add visual feedback for if answer is correct or incorrect
- Build in data feedback of performance, e.g.
  - number of questions answered
  - ratio of correct to incorrect to unanswered
  - average time taken per question
  - display detail of question responses
